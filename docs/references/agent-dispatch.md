# Multi-Agent Dispatch

> **Superseded by koryph (2026-07-20).** The `conductor/agent-dispatch.sh` contract
> described below no longer exists; single-bead dispatch is now `/koryph-build`
> and whole-wave dispatch is `/koryph-loop`. This doc is retained as historical
> record — see [`docs/references/koryph-orchestration.md`](koryph-orchestration.md)
> and [ADR 29](../designs/29-conductor-orchestration.md) for the current mechanism.

## Motivation

One human + many Claude agents editing the same checkout corrupts state fast:
overlapping diffs, racing code-generators, conflicting lockfile writes. Each
agent gets its own **git worktree** so they are isolated at the filesystem
level while sharing one `.git` directory.

## Dispatch Command

```sh
conductor/agent-dispatch.sh <phase-id> <agent-name> [--branch=<name>] [--base=main]
```

Examples:

```sh
conductor/agent-dispatch.sh phase-02 implementer
conductor/agent-dispatch.sh phase-03a security-reviewer --branch=review/phase-03a
```

The script:

1. Creates the branch off `--base` (default `main`) if it does not exist.
2. Adds a worktree under the sibling layout (below).
3. Copies `.claude/` into the worktree (or symlinks on Linux).
4. Writes `.plan-logs/<phase-id>/AGENT.md` with the assigned agent + model.
5. Prints the next-step command: `cd <worktree> && claude code`.

## Layout

Worktrees live in a sibling directory so they never appear in IDE file trees
that watch the main checkout:

```
<path-to-repo>/
  keese/                 # main checkout, branch: main
  keese-worktrees/
    phase-02-implementer/           # branch: feat/phase-02
    phase-03a-security-reviewer/    # branch: review/phase-03a
    ...
```

## Agent Selection Table

| Agent              | Model   | Typical Task                                    |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| architect          | Opus    | Draft designs (ADR), critique plans             |
| implementer        | Sonnet  | Write code, tests, docs                         |
| explorer           | Haiku   | Search, enumerate files, list symbols           |
| security-reviewer  | Opus    | Audit RBAC, auth paths, signing wiring          |
| debugger           | Haiku   | Triage failing tests, parse stack traces        |

See [model-selection.md](model-selection.md) for the cost reasoning.

## Shared Config

- `.claude/agents/*.md` — per-agent system prompts with `model:` frontmatter.
- `.claude/skills/*.md` — skills available to all agents.
- `.claude/rules/*.md` — hard rules (read-only in worktrees).
- `MEMORY.md` — **read-only** on non-main branches; only the orchestrator on
  `main` appends to it. The dispatch script sets `chmod a-w MEMORY.md` in the
  worktree to enforce this.

## Completion Protocol

When an agent finishes, it writes:

```
.plan-logs/<phase-id>/SUMMARY.md
```

Contents (minimal):

```markdown
---
phase: phase-02
agent: implementer
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
ended: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
branch: feat/phase-02
worktree: ../keese-worktrees/phase-02-implementer
status: ready-for-merge     # ready-for-merge | blocked | abandoned
---

## What shipped
- <bullet>

## Follow-ups
- <bullet>

## Test evidence
- make lint: PASS
- make test: PASS
```

The agent then exits. Merging is the orchestrator's job —
see [git-worktree-merging.md](git-worktree-merging.md).
