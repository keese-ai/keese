# references/ — HOW (steady-state)

Living cookbooks. Updated as tools, vendors, and versions evolve. Unlike designs (why)
or specs (what), references tell you **how** to do a recurring operation.

Add a reference when you find yourself explaining the same "how" twice. Update it when
a vendor or tool changes.
