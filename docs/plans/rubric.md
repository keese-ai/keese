# Plan / Spec / Implementation Rubric

Score plans, specs, and implementation iterations against this rubric. Total 100 points.
Verdicts: **SHIP ≥ 85**, **REVISE 65-84**, **REPLAN < 65**.

## Categories and weights

| # | Category | Weight | Full points require |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Scope clarity** | 10 | Goal in one sentence. Bounded inputs, outputs, exit criteria. |
| 2 | **Architecture fit** | 10 | Aligns with key beliefs; does not violate any `.claude/rules/`. |
| 3 | **Security posture** | 15 | Threat model named; secrets/least-priv; privileged operations justified. |
| 4 | **Automatability** | 10 | Every step runnable via make/script; no manual hand-waving. |
| 5 | **Verifiability** | 15 | Concrete tests: unit + integration + e2e where applicable. |
| 6 | **Failure-mode awareness** | 10 | Rollback plan; partial failure handling; known gotchas listed. |
| 7 | **Context efficiency for Claude** | 10 | Uses CLAUDE.md routing; ≤ 200-line docs; skill pointers instead of inline. |
| 8 | **Docs quality** | 5 | SPDX headers; frontmatter complete; no broken links. |
| 9 | **Observability** | 5 | Metrics, traces, events declared. |
| 10 | **Operational readiness** | 10 | HA correct; upgrade/rollback path; resource ceilings stated. |

## Scoring rules

- Full credit: every bullet under that category's rubric is fully satisfied.
- Half credit: most bullets satisfied; one notable gap.
- Zero: gap blocks safe progress.

Total = Σ(category_weight × score_ratio), where score_ratio ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}.

## Iteration cap

Maximum 3 iterations on the same decomposition. If iteration 3 still lands below SHIP,
**split** the phase or **rescope** — do not iterate a fourth time on the same plan.

Split when: the diff is growing unbounded, or unrelated risks are coupled.
Rescope when: the core problem turned out to be different from what the plan assumed.

## Using the rubric

1. Copy the template below into the target doc's `## Iteration log`.
2. Walk each category; record 0 / 0.5 / 1 and a one-line note.
3. Total, verdict, top-3 gaps, proposed next step.

## keese-specific scoring notes

- **Category 3 (Security posture)** is scored line-by-line against
  `.claude/rules/05-security-zero-trust.md`. A half-score requires naming which rule
  line is incompletely addressed.
- **Category 5 (Verifiability)** requires that envtest and kuttl test names exist
  (either in the spec's `tests:` frontmatter or in `internal/controller/**/*_test.go`).
  A doc that only names "tests will be added" scores 0 here.
- **Category 9 (Observability)** requires at least one metric name and one event
  reason cited in the doc.
- Gate rule: no spec scores ≥ 90 until its owning design doc already scores ≥ 90.

## Refinement passes

Each iteration chooses one emphasis:

1. **Correctness & security** — does it do the right thing safely?
2. **Performance & quality** — is it efficient and idiomatic?
3. **Operational readiness** — can it be deployed, observed, rolled back?

Iterations focus sharpens the review. Do not try to polish all three in one pass.
