# Contributing

Welcome. This doc is the onboarding path for new contributors (human or agent).
Start with **[How this project is organized](#how-this-project-is-organized)** — the
repo is structured deliberately and a lot of the conventions only make sense after
you see the shape.

## How this project is organized

The repo has **two brain halves**. Keep them mentally separate.

- `docs/` — knowledge **about the project** (what we're building and why).
- `.claude/` — knowledge **about how to work on the project** (rules, skills, agents,
  guardrails). Claude Code loads these; humans benefit from reading them too.

### `docs/` — five trees, one question each

| Tree | Question | Lifecycle | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|---|
| [designs/](docs/designs/) | **WHY** | Stable. Changes require a design review. | Architects, humans |
| [specs/](docs/specs/) | **WHAT** (contract) | Concrete enough that test harnesses parse it. | Implementers, test harness |
| [plans/](docs/plans/) | **HOW** (phased) | Execution-oriented. One file per phase. | Plan scorer, implementers |
| [features/](docs/features/) | **WHAT IS BUILT** | One file per implemented capability; evolves as plans iterate. | Users, support, implementers |
| [references/](docs/references/) | **HOW** (steady-state) | Living cookbooks. Updated as tools evolve. | Any role, humans |

The five trees form a pipeline:

```
designs/   →  specs/     →  plans/       →  code     →  features/
(invariants)  (contracts)   (work items)    (impl)      (implemented behavior on main)
                            ↘ references/ (cookbooks consumed throughout)
```

Every doc has YAML frontmatter and is kept under 200 lines. See
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full map.

### `.claude/`

- [rules/](.claude/rules/) — non-negotiable conventions (always loaded).
- [skills/](.claude/skills/) — on-demand how-to modules.
- [agents/](.claude/agents/) — pre-configured subagents with model tiers.
- [commands/](.claude/commands/) — slash commands.
- [hooks/](.claude/hooks/) — pre/post tool hooks (block secrets, enforce commit style, verify headers).

## Development environment

**Prerequisite — a flake-enabled Nix.** The toolchain is pinned in `flake.nix`; you
need Nix with flakes to materialize it. We recommend the
[Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer),
which enables flakes by default:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Then, from a fresh terminal in the repo root:

```sh
direnv allow                 # one-time, on first clone
nix develop                  # or rely on direnv's auto-activation
pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

See [docs/references/nix-dev-env.md](docs/references/nix-dev-env.md) and the
[development environment guide](book/docs/development/dev-environment.md#prerequisite-install-nix-with-flakes).

## Commits

Conventional Commits. Format: `type(scope): subject`.

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`, `style`.
- Subject ≤ 72 chars, imperative, lowercase, no trailing period.
- One logical change per commit.

Enforced by [`.claude/hooks/validate-conventional-commit.sh`](.claude/hooks/validate-conventional-commit.sh)
and pre-commit/CI. See [docs/references/conventional-commits.md](docs/references/conventional-commits.md).

## Copyright and SPDX headers

Every source file starts with:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
// Copyright (c) 2026 keese-ai
```

Equivalent comment syntax for other languages. `addlicense` pre-commit + the
[`enforce-spdx-header.sh`](.claude/hooks/enforce-spdx-header.sh) Claude hook enforce this.

## Secrets

- Never commit secrets.
- `.env.local` is gitignored; use `.env.local.example` for placeholders.
- `detect-secrets` + `gitleaks` run pre-commit.
- See [`.claude/rules/02-security.md`](.claude/rules/02-security.md).

## Doc hygiene

See [docs/references/documentation-system.md](docs/references/documentation-system.md).

Highlights:

- 200 lines per doc max.
- Every doc has SPDX header + YAML frontmatter.
- Link aggressively; never duplicate explanation across docs.
- `last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD` updated whenever the doc is re-read against code.

## Phase / rubric / iteration loop

1. Author a phase doc in `docs/plans/phase-NN-*.md`.
2. Run `/score-plan docs/plans/phase-NN-*.md` against
   [docs/plans/rubric.md](docs/plans/rubric.md).
3. Iterate up to 3 times. Target ≥ 90/100 before `status: in-progress`.
4. If still below SHIP at iteration 3: split or rescope.

See the [`plan-management` skill](.claude/skills/plan-management.md).

## Multi-agent worktree workflow

Parallel agent dispatch and merge are owned by [koryph](https://koryph.build), not an
in-repo script:

- Dispatch one bead into an isolated worktree: `/koryph-build <bead-id>`
- Run a whole wave of ready beads in parallel: `/koryph-loop`
- Land a finished branch: `koryph merge <branch>`

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and
[docs/references/koryph-orchestration.md](docs/references/koryph-orchestration.md).

## Model tier selection

See [docs/references/model-selection.md](docs/references/model-selection.md).

Quick heuristics:

- **Haiku** — search, summarization, log triage.
- **Sonnet** — implementation, tests, doc authoring.
- **Opus** — architecture, security review, complex refactors.

## Testing

See [`.claude/rules/06-testing.md`](.claude/rules/06-testing.md).

Core rules:

- Race detector (or equivalent) enabled in CI.
- Never `sleep` in tests — use `Eventually` / polling.
- Table-driven tests; no shared mutable globals.
- Don't mock types you don't own.
